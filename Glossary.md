## Introduction

The project glossary is a collection of terms captured from models and shapes the **ubiquitous language**. Each term is defined with its meaning specific to the project domain.

<aside>
⚠️ This is a live document. Thus it should be reviewed if it is determined that any of the terms no longer accurately reflect the genuine ubiquitous language. We place a high value on ubiquitous language, so taking the extra time to honor it properly during refactoring is essential.
